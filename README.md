# Personality Prediction Using the Myers-Briggs (MBTI) and Keirsey-Model

Machine Learning Algorithms can be used to learn from a user’s social
media data and infer his/her behavioral type.

The goal of this repository is to identify if there are behavioral patterns in the information
shared in social media that can be mapped with high precision into the psychological types of
the MBTI or the temperaments of Keirsey.

The proposed framework infers temperament types following the David Keirsey’s model, and psychological types based on the MBTI model. On the twitter data 4 models have been trained – Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours with showed an accuracy of 77%, 78%, 81% and 79%.
