# Personality Prediction Using the Myers-Briggs (MBTI) and Keirsey-Model

Which type of a person are you? Given seven billion living people, it is a difficult question to answer. The leading personality type theory today classifies humanity into these 16 personality types on the basis of psychological types and 4 on the Keisey Model.

Machine Learning Algorithms can be used to learn from a user’s social
media data and infer his/her behavioral type.

The goal of this repository is to identify if there are behavioral patterns in the information
shared in social media that can be mapped with high precision into the psychological types of
the MBTI or the temperaments of Keirsey.

The proposed framework infers temperament types following the David Keirsey’s model, and psychological types based on the MBTI model. On the twitter data 4 models have been trained – Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours with showed an accuracy of 77%, 78%, 81% and 79%.

# Four Temperaments by Keirsey

David Keirsey expanded on the ancient study of temperament by Hippocrates and Plato. In his works, Keirsey used the names suggested by Plato: Artisan (iconic), Guardian (pistic), Idealist (noetic), and Rational (dianoetic). Keirsey divided the four temperaments into two categories (roles), each with two types (role variants). The resulting 16 types correlate with the 16 personality types described by Briggs and Myers (MBTI).

## Artisans
    Composer (ISFP)
    Crafter (ISTP)
    Performer (ESFP)
    Promoter (ESTP)

## Guardians
    Inspector (ISTJ)
    Protector (ISFJ)
    Provider (ESFJ)
    Supervisor (ESTJ)

## Idealists
    Champion (ENFP)
    Counselor (INFJ)
    Healer (INFP)
    Teacher (ENFJ)

## Rationals
    Architect (INTP)
    Fieldmarshal (ENTJ)
    Inventor (ENTP)
    Mastermind (INTJ)


### In other words one can say that Keirsey Model plays an integrated role in MYer-Briggs but not solely into it.
